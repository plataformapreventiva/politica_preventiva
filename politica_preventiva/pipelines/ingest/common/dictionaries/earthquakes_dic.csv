Note that large earthquakes can continue rupturing for many 10's of seconds. We provide time in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time). Seismologists use UTC to avoid confusion caused by local time zones and daylight savings time. On the individual event pages, times are also provided for the time at the epicenter, and your local time based on the time your computer is set."|2018-100-d
latitude|latitud|earthquake.usgs.gov|https://earthquake.usgs.gov/data/comcat/data-eventterms.php||||2018-04-13 02:49:41.532846|An earthquake begins to rupture at a hypocenter which is defined by a position on the surface of the earth (epicenter) and a depth below this point (focal depth). We provide the coordinates of the epicenter in units of latitude and longitude. The latitude is the number of degrees north (N) or south (S) of the equator and varies from 0 at the equator to 90 at the poles. The longitude is the number of degrees east (E) or west (W) of the prime meridian which runs through Greenwich, England. The longitude varies from 0 at Greenwich to 180 and the E or W shows the direction from Greenwich. Coordinates are given in the WGS84 reference frame. The position uncertainty of the hypocenter location varies from about 100 m horizontally and 300 meters vertically for the best located events, those in the middle of densely spaced seismograph networks, to 10s of kilometers for global events in many parts of the world.|2018-100-d

depth|profundidad|earthquake.usgs.gov|https://earthquake.usgs.gov/data/comcat/data-eventterms.php||||2018-04-13 02:49:41.532846|The depth where the earthquake begins to rupture. This depth may be relative to the WGS84 geoid, mean sea-level, or the average elevation of the seismic stations which provided arrival-time data for the earthquake location. The choice of reference depth is dependent on the method used to locate the earthquake, which varies by seismic network. Since ComCat includes data from many different seismic networks, the process for determining the depth is different for different events. The depth is the least-constrained parameter in the earthquake location, and the error bars are generally larger than the variation due to different depth determination methods. Sometimes when depth is poorly constrained by available seismic data, the location program will set the depth at a fixed value. For example, 33 km is often used as a default depth for earthquakes determined to be shallow, but whose depth is not satisfactorily determined by the data, whereas default depths of 5 or 10 km are often used in mid-continental areas and on mid-ocean ridges since earthquakes in these areas are usually shallower than 33 km|2018-100-d
mag|magnitud|earthquake.usgs.gov|https://earthquake.usgs.gov/data/comcat/data-eventterms.php||||2018-04-13 02:49:41.532846|"The magnitude reported is that which the U.S. Geological Survey considers official for this earthquake, and was the best available estimate of the earthquake’s size, at the time that this page was created. Other magnitudes associated with web pages linked from here are those determined at various times following the earthquake with different types of seismic data. Although they are legitimate estimates of magnitude, the U.S. Geological Survey does not consider them to be the preferred ""official"" magnitude for the event. Earthquake magnitude is a measure of the size of an earthquake at its source. It is a logarithmic measure. At the same distance from the earthquake, the amplitude of the seismic waves from which the magnitude is determined are approximately 10 times as large during a magnitude 5 earthquake as during a magnitude 4 earthquake. The total amount of energy released by the earthquake usually goes up by a larger factor: for many commonly used magnitude types, the total energy of an average earthquake goes up by a factor of approximately 32 for each unit increase in magnitude. There are various ways that magnitude may be calculated from seismograms. Different methods are effective for different sizes of earthquakes and different distances between the earthquake source and the recording station. The various magnitude types are generally defined so as to yield magnitude values that agree to within a few-tenths of a magnitude-unit for earthquakes in a middle range of recorded-earthquake sizes, but the various magnitude-types may have values that differ by more than a magnitude-unit for very large and very small earthquakes as well as for some specific classes of seismic source. This is because earthquakes are commonly complex events that release energy over a wide range of frequencies and at varying amounts as the faulting or rupture process occurs. The various types of magnitude measure different aspects of the seismic radiation (e.g., low-frequency energy vs. high-frequency energy). The relationship among values of different magnitude types that are assigned to a particular seismic event may enable the seismologist to better understand the processes at the focus of the seismic event. The various magnitude-types are not all available at the same time for a particular earthquake. Preliminary magnitudes based on incomplete but rapidly-available data are sometimes estimated and reported. For example, the Tsunami Warning Centers will calculate a preliminary magnitude and location for an event as soon as sufficient data are available to make an estimate. In this case, time is of the essence in order to broadcast a warning if tsunami waves are likely to be generated by the event. Such preliminary magnitudes are superseded by improved estimates of magnitude as more data become available. For large earthquakes of the present era, the magnitude that is ultimately selected as the preferred magnitude for reporting to the public is commonly a moment magnitude that is based on the scalar seismic-moment of an earthquake determined by calculation of the seismic moment-tensor that best accounts for the character of the seismic waves generated by the earthquake. The scalar seismic-moment, a parameter of the seismic moment-tensor, can also be estimated via the multiplicative product rigidity of faulted rock x area of fault rupture x average fault displacement during the earthquake."|2018-100-d
